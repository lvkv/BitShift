# BitShift
BitShift is a 2048 remake with a couple twists.

#### How to Play:
* Use arrow keys to shift tiles up, down, left or right
* Like tiles will overlap and combine value, adding to your score
* Get the highest score before filling the board up and losing

#### Twists
* The board size may be customized to any height and width combination between a 4x4 and an 8x8 square.
* Players have the ability to "bitshift", which moves every tile one space to the left, sliding the leftmost column completely off the board (Ha! Like a bitshift! Clever clever). The catch is that any tiles that fall off the board will be subtracted from the player's score. The second catch is that players only have three bitshifts available.

#### You somehow made this game look uglier than it already does
It's a bad habit
